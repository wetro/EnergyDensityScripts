EnergyDensityScripts
====================

A collection of various Energy Density Calculators


Based of the equation E = (C*V^2)/8 in units of Wh/kg, this program can calculate:

1) Theoretical Energy Density given a desired Voltage and Capacitance

2) Theoretical Capacitance given a desired Energy Density and Nominal Voltage

3) Theoretical Voltage given a desired Energy Density and Capacitance
